# Assembly-Simulator

## Project Overview

Assembly‑Simulator is a lightweight, educational CPU and assembly runtime written in C. It allows you to load small assembly programs, execute them step‑by‑step or at full speed, and observe how instructions manipulate registers, memory, and the stack. The focus is on clarity and portability: the core is implemented in C for predictable, fast execution, with minimal dependencies and simple build scripts (Makefile, optional CMake).
